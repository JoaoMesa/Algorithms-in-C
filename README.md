Some of the most basic algorithms for Computer Science, implemented in C language. Those were specially useful for Introduction to Programming, Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures and Organization and Recovery of Information classes during my time in college at UFSCar.

It includes data structures such as lists, binary trees and b-trees, besides graph and sorting algorithms.
